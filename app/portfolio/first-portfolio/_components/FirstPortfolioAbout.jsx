      <p>My first developer portfolio and one of my earliest React projects.</p>
      <p>
        It's a single-page app (SPA) built with Vite, React 18, and styled using
        both Tailwind CSS and Material UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site features a futuristic aesthetic and was my intro to tools like
        React Query and other libraries like React Simple Maps.
      </p>
      <p>Itâ€™s a bit old now, but I still view it as a fun little milestone.</p>
