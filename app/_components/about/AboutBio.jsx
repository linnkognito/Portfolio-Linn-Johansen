      <p>
        Hi! I’m an aspiring web developer — or maybe more accurately, a
        design-dev hybrid — based in <Bold>Portland, OR</Bold>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since March 2024, I’ve been deep in the world of JavaScript, React, and
        modern frontend development through self-guided learning and hands-on
        projects. I love building clean, functional, and user-focused interfaces
        — and I’m not afraid to go full-stack when the project calls for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before dev life, I spent nearly a decade in visual merchandising —
        planning, styling, and collaborating with tight-knit teams. These days,
        I bring that same creative eye and project-driven mindset into every
        line of code.
      </p>
